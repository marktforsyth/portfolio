# Healer 2 Platformer

This is a simple little platformer, with working physics and collision and 'camera' movement. It was originally named Healer because I planned to make it a healing game where the character would go around healing people, and it has the title '2' because when version 1 got very messy and buggy I ended up going for a fresh start and making this :).
