# HTML, CSS, & JavaScript

I have worked with these languages quite a bit, and feel confident using them. I use these relatively often right now for projects that I want to make, mostly for simple ones.

Links to external repos in HTML, CSS & JavaScript:

- [DungeonCrawlerWeb](https://github.com/marktforsyth/DungeonCrawlerWeb)
- [TicTacToeWeb](https://github.com/marktforsyth/TicTacToeWeb)
- [story-squares](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/storysquares) (I like this one a lot --also, it's hosted on glitch not github)
