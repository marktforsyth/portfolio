# Programming Portfolio
This is my programming portfolio, where you can see the projects I've worked on and skills I've developed!

Each of the different folders in the main directory corresponds to a programming language that I've used. Inside each folder, you will find many of my programming projects in that specific language.

In many of my projects, I have collaborated with and recieved help from my older brother [Jared](https://github.com/jaredly), and I will mention which projects those are, assuming that I can remember (some of these were made a few years ago).

Thank you for taking a look at my portfolio! Enjoy! :)
