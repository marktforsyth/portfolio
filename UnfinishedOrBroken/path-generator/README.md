# Path Generator

This is a really HTML, CSS & JavaScript program that generates a random path, which could be used in auto-generating a maze. My brother Jared helped me out with the logic of this program.

Unfortunately, right now it doesn't work because it's trying to use `.indexOf()` with a 2d complex array, which doesn't work. I think that I may eventually come back to fix it by using more for loops or changing things to strings or something like that.
