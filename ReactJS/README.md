# ReactJS

I really like using React, and I think it's a very powerful tool! Currently I'm working with my brother Jared on his [Foood](https://github.com/jaredly/local-first/tree/master/examples/foood) project --a recipe database for our family. I've only started using React recently, but I'm learning a lot.
